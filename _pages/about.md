I am currently a senior studying at Harvard University pursuing a bachelor's in computer science and math and a concurrent master's in computer science.

My research interests broadly lie in neural network pruning. More specifically, I am interested in the effects network pruning (and more generally network connectivity) has on network dynamics. I hope to use an improved understanding of this relationship in order to construct more interpretable, efficient and robust pruned networks. 

I am lucky enough to currently be working with [Professor Daniela Rus](https://danielarus.csail.mit.edu/) at MIT CSAIL doing research on the aforementioned problems in the context of recurrent neural networks. I am also (separately) working with [Professor Nir Shavit](https://www.csail.mit.edu/person/nir-shavit), extending my investigation of network connectivity to the realm of biological neural networks.
